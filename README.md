# ProfileX

## ProgramID : CChCHZ73fCThaPfKJKjSJqmHxm9yubpCTEsu6ZmHAe4C


## Overview

ProfileX is a decentralized platform on Solana for developers to submit and validate projects. It addresses the lack of transparent, trustless systems for showcasing skills and contributions. Developers submit projects with skills and GitHub links, validated by community vetters via smart contracts. Token rewards incentivize participation, ensuring fairness and trust.

## Problem

Centralized platforms for project showcasing often lack transparency, are prone to bias, and fail to validate project quality or reward contributors fairly.
