# ProfileX

## ProgramID : CChCHZ73fCThaPfKJKjSJqmHxm9yubpCTEsu6ZmHAe4C

## Overview

ProfileX is a decentralized platform on Solana for developers to submit and validate projects. It addresses the lack of transparent, trustless systems for showcasing skills and contributions. Developers submit projects with skills and GitHub links, validated by community vetters via smart contracts. Token rewards incentivize participation, ensuring fairness and trust.

## Problem

Centralized platforms for project showcasing often lack transparency, are prone to bias, and fail to validate project quality or reward contributors fairly.

## Solution

ProfileX leverages Solanaâ€™s high-speed blockchain for:

- **Project Submission**: Developers upload projects with skills and links.
- **Community Validation**: Vetter score projects transparently.
- **Token Rewards**: Submitters and vetters earn tokens.
- **Decentralized Trust**: Smart contracts ensure fairness using Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-History.

## Features

- Submit projects with GitHub links and skills (e.g., Rust, JS, Anchor).
- Vetting by community-selected validators.
- Transparent scoring and token rewards.
- Built on Solana for speed and low costs.
